!!! note "Course Objectives"
    Installing OpenShift on a cloud, virtual, or physical infrastructure.


!!! warning "Notice"
    all nodes are treated as bare metal servers, even though they are actually virtual machines in an OpenStack cluster.

    OpenShift cloud-provider integration capabilities are not enabled. A few features that depend on that integration, such as machine sets and autoscaling of cluster nodes, are not available.

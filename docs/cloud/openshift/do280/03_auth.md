# 1. Configure Identity Providers
The OpenShift OAuth server can be configured to use many identity providers. The most common ones:

## HTPasswd

    HTPasswd is a simple authentication mechanism that uses an Apache-style `.htpasswd` file to store user credentials.
It validates usernames and passwords against a secret that stores credentials that are generated by using the htpasswd command.

- Keystone
Enables shared authentication with an OpenStack Keystone v3 server.

- LDAP
Configures the LDAP identity provider to validate usernames and passwords against an LDAPv3 server, by using simple bind authentication.

- GitHub or GitHub Enterprise
Configures a GitHub identity provider to validate usernames and passwords against GitHub or the GitHub Enterprise OAuth authentication server.

- OpenID Connect
Integrates with an OpenID Connect identity provider by using an Authorization Code Flow.

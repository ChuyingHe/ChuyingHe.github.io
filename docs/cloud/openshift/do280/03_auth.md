# 1. OpenShift Users and Groups
以下这些OC Resources与 **authentication & authorization** 有关：

- `user`: credential for external entities such as user or external system, it interacts with **API server**.  
- `identiy`: keeps a record of successful authentication attempts from a specific user and identity provider. 
- `serviceaccount` / `sa`: credential for applications/services running on the cluster。
- `group`: set of `user`
- `role`: it defines set of allowed API operations for `user`, `group` or `serviceaccount`


!!! info "identity"
    ```bash
    > oc get identity
    NAME                   IDP NAME   IDP USER NAME  USER NAME  USER UID
    ...                    ...        ...            admin      6126c5a9-4d18-4cdf-95f7-b16c3d3e7f24

    ```

!!! warning "user VS sa"
    ⚠️ `serviceaccount` can be considered as ONE TYPE of `user`

    ||`user`|`serviceaccount`|
    |:-|:-|:-|
    |使用者|一个人，或一个外部系统（例如 CI/CD 工具）|应用程序，或服务|
    |管理方式|- 用户的认证信息存储在 <ins>外部系统</ins>（如身份提供商），而不是 OpenShift 内部。<br/>- OpenShift 支持多种用户认证方式|- 是集群中的资源，可以通过 YAML 或 CLI 管理。<br/>- 每个命名空间都有默认的 `default` ServiceAccount|
    |适用场景|- 开发者、管理员等直接操作 OpenShift 集群的用户。<br/>- 通过 CLI、Web 控制台或 API 与集群交互。<br/>- 外部集成系统需要通过用户身份进行认证（如 OAuth）。|- 用于 Pod 的运行时身份，Pod 使用 ServiceAccount 与集群交互。<br/>- 自动分配 Token，用于 API 访问的身份认证。<br/>- 应用程序需要读取 ConfigMap、Secrets 等集群资源时|


!!! info "User Types"
    1. Regular User: they are represented as `user` resource
    2. System User: Many system users are created automatically when the infrastructure is defined. For instance: cluster administrator (with access to everything), a per-node user, users for routers and registries, and various others. <br/>System user names start with a `system:` prefix, such as `system:admin`, `system:openshift-registry`, and `system:node:node1.example.com`.
    3. `serviceaccount`

## Group

```bash
# create Group
oc adm groups new lead-developers

# add User to a Group
oc adm groups add-users lead-developers user1
```


# Authentication

assigns the cluster-admin role to the student user so that the `student` user can do anything in the cluster:
```bash
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin student
```


The OpenShift API has two methods for authenticating requests:

## X.509 client certificates
it use the `kubeconfig` file, which embeds an X.509 client certificate that never expires. 

During installation, the OpenShift installer creates a unique kubeconfig file in the auth directory. The kubeconfig file contains specific details and parameters for the CLI to connect a client to the correct API server, including an X.509 certificate.

The installation logs provide the location of the kubeconfig file like this:
```bash
# log
INFO Run 'export KUBECONFIG=/root/auth/kubeconfig' to manage the cluster with 'oc'.
```

To use the `kubeconfig` file to authenticate oc commands, do this:
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/home/user/auth/kubeconfig
```

## OAuth access tokens
it authenticate as the `kubeadmin` virtual user. Successful authentication grants an OAuth access token.

After installation completes, OpenShift creates the `kubeadmin` virtual user. The `kubeadmin` secret in the `kube-system` namespace contains the hashed password for the kubeadmin user. The kubeadmin user has cluster administrator privileges.

The installation logs provide the kubeadmin credentials like this:

```bash
# log
...output omitted...
INFO The cluster is ready when 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p shdU_trbi_6ucX_edbu_aqop'
...output omitted...
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here:
     https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: shdU_trbi_6ucX_edbu_aqop
```




# 2. Configure Identity Providers

The OpenShift OAuth server can be configured to use many identity providers. The most common ones:

## HTPasswd

<img src="../imgs/apache.png" width="100" />

HTPasswd is a simple authentication mechanism that uses an Apache-style `.htpasswd` file to store user credentials.

It validates usernames and passwords against a secret that stores credentials that are generated by using the htpasswd command.

### Create user
Creating an HTPasswd File:

```bash
# Create the htpasswd file
#  -> the password `redhat123` will be hashed with the MD5 algorithm
htpasswd -c -B -b /tmp/htpasswd student redhat123

# Add or update credentials
htpasswd -b /tmp/htpasswd student redhat1234

# delete
htpasswd -D /tmp/htpasswd student

# Creating OC Secret with HTPasswd credential:
# ⚠️ After `--from-file` you need to add `htpasswd=` prefix before the file path:
oc create secret generic htpasswd-secret \
    --from-file htpasswd=/tmp/htpasswd -n openshift-config

# Extracting Secret to a file that locates under directory /tmp/
oc extract secret/htpasswd-secret -n openshift-config \
    --to /tmp/ --confirm

# Updating the OC HTPasswd Secret
oc set data secret/htpasswd-secret \
    --from-file htpasswd=/tmp/htpasswd -n openshift-config
```

!!! info "htpasswd文件示例"
    ```bash
    > cat ~/DO280/labs/auth-providers/htpasswd
    new_admin:$2y$05$qQaFbpx4hbf4uZe.SMLSduTN8uN4DNJMJ4jE5zXDA57WrTRlpu2QS
    new_developer:$apr1$S0TxtLXl$QSRfBIufYP39pKNsIg/nD1
    ```


### Delete Users

```bash
# delete user data in the file
htpasswd -D /tmp/htpasswd manager

# update the OC secret
oc set data secret/htpasswd-secret \
  --from-file htpasswd=/tmp/htpasswd -n openshift-config

# ACTUALLY delete the OC USER resource (named `manager` in this case)
oc delete user manager


# ACTUALLY delete the OC IDENTITY resources
#  -> `my_htpasswd_provider` is the name of the `identityProviders` that we defined in the OAuth
oc get identities | grep manager
oc delete identity my_htpasswd_provider:manager
```

### Configuring the OAuth Custom Resource
To use the HTPasswd identity provider, the OAuth custom resource must be edited to add an entry to the .spec.identityProviders array:
```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_htpasswd_provider 
    mappingMethod: claim 
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpasswd-secret 
```

!!! info "alternative"
    ```bash
    oc get oauth cluster -o yaml > oauth.yaml
    oc replace -f oauth.yamls
    ```


!!! note "`oc replace` VS `oc apply`"
    Some resources have immutable fields that apply won't let you change. For example, a deployment cannot have its selectors changed. `oc replace` can be used in these situations.

    - `oc apply` actually does a diff and updates the resource with a patch of the changes. 
    - `oc replace` will submit the full entire spec of the resource, as an atomic action.

!!! info "namespaces"
    The `openshift-config` namespace is used to store global configuration data for the cluster, including authentication configurations.

    The `openshift-authentication` namespace is responsible for running the authentication services.



## Keystone
Enables shared authentication with an OpenStack Keystone v3 server.

## LDAP
Configures the LDAP identity provider to validate usernames and passwords against an LDAPv3 server, by using simple bind authentication.

## GitHub or GitHub Enterprise
Configures a GitHub identity provider to validate usernames and passwords against GitHub or the GitHub Enterprise OAuth authentication server.

## OpenID Connect
Integrates with an OpenID Connect identity provider by using an Authorization Code Flow.




# 3. Define and Apply Permissions with RBAC
**Role-based access control (RBAC)** is a technique for managing access to resources in a computer system. RBAC determines whether a user can perform certain actions within the cluster or project. There are 2 RBAC levels:

- Cluster RBAC: Roles and bindings that apply across all projects.
- Local RBAC: Roles and bindings that are scoped to a given project. Local role bindings can reference both cluster and local roles.


## RBAC Object

- **Rule**: Allowed actions for objects or groups of objects.
- **Role**: Sets of rules. Users and groups can be associated with multiple roles.
- **Binding**: Assignment of users or groups to a role.

## CLIs
|CLI||
|:-|:-|
|`oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin username`|To change a regular user to a cluster administrator(`cluster-admin` role)|
|`oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user cluster-admin username`|To change a cluster administrator(`cluster-admin` role) to a regular user|
|`oc adm policy who-can delete user`| to determine which user can perform what(`delete user` in this case)|

!!! note "role & cluster role"
    to use **local role** instead of **cluster role**, use `add-role-to-user` instead of `add-cluster-role-to-user`

## Default Roles
besides the `cluster-admin`, there are these roles:

|Default roles|Description|
|:-|:-|
|`admin`|Users with this role can manage all project resources, including granting access to other users to access the project.|
|`basic-user`|Users with this role have read access to the project.|
|`cluster-admin`|Users with this role have superuser access to the cluster resources. These users can perform any action on the cluster, and have full control of all projects.|
|`cluster-status`|Users with this role can access cluster status information.|
|`cluster-reader`|Users with this role can access or view most of the objects but cannot modify them.|
|`edit`|Users with this role can create, change, and delete common application resources on the project, such as services and deployments. These users cannot act on management resources such as limit ranges and quotas, and cannot manage access permissions to the project.|
|`self-provisioner`|Users with this role can create their own projects.|
|`view`|Users with this role can view project resources, but cannot modify project resources.||

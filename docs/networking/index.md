# CIDR
## CIDR blocks
A CIDR block is a group of IP addresses that share the same start and size. Big blocks have more IP addresses. Big internet groups give out large CIDR blocks to smaller groups. These smaller groups then give them to companies. If youâ€™re at home, you get your CIDR block from your internet company.


## CIDR notation
CIDR notation shows an IP address with a number at the end. This number tells how much of the address is for the network. For example the 192.168.1.0/22 means the first 22 bits of the address are for a network. This way of writing a IP addresses helps the routers know where to send the data.

## Agile practices
1. Social contract: a simple agreement that defines how a group will work together “at its best.”

3. Wall of work: a simple, visual way to track progress. (TODO, In Progress, Done in Trello board)
4. Stand-up: short status meetings, usually done daily.
    - What have you completed since the last stand-up?
    - What will you complete by the next stand-up?
    - What are the blockers keeping you from successfully completing your tasks?
5. Retrospective: to look back in thought or to reflect. 
6. Showcase: a meeting where the team presents the completed work to the stakeholders and obtains feedback for moving forward. 
7. Shuhari:
    - shu (protect): to follow with no deviation.
    - ha (detach): become innovativ

## Agile patterns:

1.	Strategy and governance pattern: helps leaders develop the direction in which the company will go. 战略咨询层面的，是C level的人要考虑的
2.	Operations pattern is for continuous, repeatable, and day-to-day work. 一些日常重复工作
3.	Programs pattern is for project work that has a definite start and end. 项目（有头有尾）

All three patterns follow the same five steps or phases:

1. Mobilize
2. Understand
3. Explore and strategize
4. Build, test, and implement
5. Manage and evolve

!!! note "Attention"
    But different pattern has different practices.

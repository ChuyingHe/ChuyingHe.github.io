# Deadlines
How long does it need to implement the Achitecture? What will impact the schedule?

1. Technology Stack choice: `Queue` takes longer than `REST API`
2. Devloper's Skill: unknown technologies might result in:
   1. Delay
   2. Low Quality


!!! note "Note"
    Do not include products in the architecture that have no one assigned for taking care of them. Always prefer products that IT department knows and support.

# Cost
Cost Mgmt can MAKE or BREAK a project!

1. Buy vs Build: always estimate **cost** vs **value**

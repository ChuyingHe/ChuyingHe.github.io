2. **Requirements**: to validate your understanding
      - Functional: What the system should do? 
        
        `The system should allow adding, removing and updating employee's data`

      - Non-functional: With what should the system deal? Should be extremely accurate.

3.**Executive Summary**: should be NON-technical, to provide high-level view for the CXOs and boost confidence of your work. Some tips:
      - Use charts & diagram
      - write it AFTER the rest of document -> because its a summary
4. **Architecture Overview**: to provide high-level view of the architecture, no deep-dive to specific components. It should includes:
       -  General descriptino
       -  High-level diagram
       -  Diagram walkthrough
5. **Components Drill-down**: For each component we need to describe:
       - Component;s role
       - technology stack
       - Component’s Architecture

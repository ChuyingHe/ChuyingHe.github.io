# Mindset
As an architect, you should consider both perspective for deveoper and foreign for a developer.

## 1. Understand the business

!!! note
    What does the company do? Knowing Microsoft is producing and selling software is not enough, you should also know: founder, revenue, benefit and competitors.

    Summary: you need to understand what keeps the CEO wake at the night

Make yourself familiar with:
    
- Weaknesses
- Strengths
- Competition
- Grouwth Strategy

!!! warning
    An architect shouldn't think her system as a standalone system, it should integrate into the eco-system of the company.

## 2. The System's Goal
Goals are not Requirements, not "what the system should do", goals describe the effect on the organization --> always think about the big system.

!!! note "Example"
    I once had a client that asked me to design the architecture of a specific system for him. The system specifications were clear. The value services and screens were already defined and it looked like an easy task. However, when we began discussing the place of the system in the organization, we found out almost no one was going to use the system as it is. There were many other systems which performed similar tasks, albeit in a less comfortable manner, but the users were already used to those systems and there was simply not a strong enough incentive for them to move to the new one.

    We ended up changing almost all of the systems scope and functionality, and the final product was a much smaller, but much more focused and effective system.

## 3. Your client's client

Commonly:

- Client: IT department who hires you
- Client's client: the end user

Your client's client is prioritized over the comfort of your client.

## 4. Watch your language
> Always keep in mind what is the thing that really matters to the person you are talking to.

!!! note "example"
    - Project manager: only cares about Project Sucess
    - Tech team leader: programming
    - CEO: Financial botton line, NEVER technical buzzwords

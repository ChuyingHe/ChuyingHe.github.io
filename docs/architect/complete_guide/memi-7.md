Why is it important?

- Irreversible
- Emotional

Decision must be:

-  made with clear mind (very rational)
-  heavily documented
-  group effort (discuss with your developers)


Technology Stack Considerations

1. Can perform the required tasks?
2. Community ([stackoverflow tags](https://stackoverflow.com/tags))
3. Popularity ([google trend](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=DE&q=reactjs,nodejs&hl=en-GB))

# Frontend

# Backend
WebApps, WebAPI, Console and Service could all be counted as **Backend**. Here are some popular backend applications:
## .NET Classic
- founded by Microsoft in 2001 as a response for Java
- General purpose
- Object-oriented
- Statically-typed 
- IDE: Visual Studio
- Windows only
- Performance okish
- Very mature
- Blurred roadmap

It is default choice for Windows-based application.

!!! note "Statically-typed vs Dynamically-typed"
    In **statically-typed** languages, the data types of variables are known and checked at compile-time, before the program is run. E.g.: C, C++, Java, C#, Swift, Go

    In contrast, **dynamically-typed** languages where type checking is done at runtime. E.g.: Python, JS, TS, PHP, R

## .NET Core
- Next generation of .NET,
- Cross-platform support and performance.
- a flexible and fast platform
- but not fully baked yet
- fast growing community

## Java
- founded in 1995 by Sun Microsystems
- very popular
- General purpose
- Object-oriented
- Statically-typed 
- Huge community


## node.js
- founded on 2009 by Ryan Dahl
- optimized for highly concurrent Web Apps.
- JavaScript-based
- dynamically typed
- large community
- great performance


As mentioned, Node.js is not targeted for long running processes so don't try to build services with it. But for Web Apps that require a lot of short, concurrent I/O operations, its the best choice.

## PHP
- founded in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdof
- Messy
- easy to learn
- not polished enough.
- large community.

PHP is focused on Web Apps and Web API, not suitable for long running component

## Python
- Founded on 1989 by Guido van Rossum
- scripting language
- the easiest language to learn
- large community
- can perform almost any task

You can consider Python for almost any type of application including Web App, Web API, console, or service.

!!! note "SLI & SLO"
    **Service Level Indicator (SLI)**

    An SLI is a quantitative measure of a specific aspect of service performance. It indicates how well a service is performing based on certain key metrics. SLIs are typically tied to user experience and help identify how a system is functioning in real-time. Examples of SLIs:

        - Availability: The percentage of time a service is up and accessible.
        - Latency: The time it takes for a service to respond to a request.
        - Error Rate: The percentage of failed requests out of total requests.
        - Throughput: The rate at which requests are successfully handled by the system.
    
    **Service Level Objective (SLO)**
    An SLO is a target or goal set for an SLI over a specified time period. It defines the level of performance that a service must achieve to meet the expectations of users or stakeholders. SLOs help teams set realistic and measurable objectives to maintain service quality, acting as benchmarks for reliability. Examples of SLOs:

        - Availability SLO: 99.9% uptime over a month.
        - Latency SLO: 95% of requests should respond within 200 milliseconds.
        - Error Rate SLO: Error rate should not exceed 1% of total requests.

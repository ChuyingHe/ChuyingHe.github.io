# Intro
<img src="../imgs/apm_history.png" width=600 alt="History of APM development" />

Instana is AI powered APM(Application Performance Monitoring) solution that automatically monitors containerized, microservice applciations. It trys to automate much things as possible in the **Application Lifecycle**:

This is what Instana wants to archieve:

# Key Concepts
## 1. Auto Discovery
- One **agent**, deployed once
- Continuous real-time inventory of all components
- Automatic tracing:
    - fully automatic (zero touch) for: Java, Scala, Python, PHP, .net
    - requires Instana library inclusion: NodeJS, Golang, Ruby, Crystal
- 1 Second Granularity: big advantage in highly dynamic environment, if you have details that accurate to each seconds, you are able to see which problem comes first.

## 2. Dynamic Graph
Dynamic Graph is a **depedency tree** between all the infrastructures. It shows the connections between the services.

!!! note "Example"
    In this Dynamic Graph, there are 5 hosts: 4 for ElasticSearch, 1 for SpringBoot

## 3. Data Collection / 数据收集
数据收集是指通过各种方法、工具和技术，从软件系统中实时提取与性能、行为相关的指标、日志和追踪信息的过程。Instana收集4种信息：

1. **Metrics** - Qualitative attributes of the technology that indicate performance. E.g.:
    - Process CPU
    - Service latency
    - Web Page load time
2. **Events** - Changes: Initial discovery and state changes, Built-In Events based on failing health rules and Custom Events based on the thresholds. E.g.:
    - Host offline
    - Docker container offline
    - JVM GC Suspension High
    - Service Latency Slow
3. **Configuration** - Catalogs current settings and states in order to keep track of any configuration change
4. **Traces** - Represent transactions and are captured based upon the programming language platform. Traces are made up of one or more Calls. Java, Scala, Net, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, others via SDK.


## 4. Data Retention / 数据保留
**数据保留**是指存储已收集数据的时间长度以及如何管理这些数据以优化存储成本、性能和合规性。涉及**时间维度**，**储存策略**，**合规性要求**等等

1. **Metrics** Data Retention
    - 1 Second Granularity is stored for the last 24 hours
    - 5 Seconds for 24 hours
    - 60 seconds for 1 month
    - 5 minutes for 3 months
    - 1 hour for 13 months
2. **Events** Data Retention
    - Life of Contract
3. **Dynamic Graph/Configuration** Data Retention
    - Life of Contract
4. **Traces** Data Retention
    - 100% Full Traces for last 7 days
    - Significant Calls and KPIs for 1 year


## 5. Built-in Intelligence

- Curated Knowledge Base
    - Health Signatures & Thresholds for discovered technologies
- Pattern Detection Algorithms
    - Edge Detection/边缘检测：是图像处理和计算机视觉中的基本问题，边缘检测的目的是标识数字图像中亮度变化明显的点。图像属性中的显著变化通常反映了属性的重要事件和变化。
- Dynamic Graph
    - Entity Relationships
- Learning of Normal Patterns

# UI

## Tenants
Each Account can have one or more **Tenants** which can be hosted either in the Instana SaaS environment or On Prem.

- `prod-example.instana.io` -> Saas
- `pra-instana.example.com` -> On Prem (Single Docker or K8S)


## Filters

- Time picker / Release
- Toggle visibility using the Legend
- Time correlation when interacting with Chart
- Diagram: Swipe mouse for more options


# Agent
## Installation
How to install **Instana Agents** in Instana itself. 

<img src="../imgs/install-1.png" width=600>
<img src="../imgs/install-2.png" width=600>


- Mirror the technology in use
    - **K8S**: use the daemonset/operator/helm chart
    - **Docker**: use the Instana Agent Docker container
    - **Host**(e.g. Linux): use the host agent for the OS
- In each case the result will be 1 agent on each host (or worker node)

## Agent Modes
The agent has two modes: `APM` or `INFRA`:

- **APM** (Application Performance Monitoring) License:: FULL traces including infrastructure(`INFRA`)
- **INFRA** (Infrastructure Monitoring) License:: only infrastructure traces

<img src="../imgs/modes.png" width=800>

## Agent Deployment Options
Instana Agent Deployment/Configuration Options:

|<div style="width:400px">Dynamic</div>|<div style="width:400px">Static</div>|
|:-|:-|
|starts with minimal requirements, slowly loads other ONLY when necessary|fixed size from the beginning, has everything|
|- Agent Bootstrap <br/>- **Sensors** loaded dynamically from repository (Instana or Mirrored) <br/>- Configurable, scheduled updates <br/>- Always on the latest version of Instana + **sensors** <br/>- Can be pinned <br/>- Reinstall only required to update the Agent Bootstrap <br/>|- Package includes all **sensors**<br/>- **Sensors** are already present<br/>- Startup time is faster!<br/>- Upgrades need a more traditional approach<br/>- Perfect for air-gapped and more traditional environments<br/>- New install required to bump sensor or bootstrap versions<br/>|


!!! note "What to choose? Dynamic vs Static"
    Treat this choice like any other software update strategy, ask yourself these questions:

    - What type of environment is it?
    - What are the characteristics of the environment?
    - Is it change controlled?
    - Should it be predictable?


## Agent Configuration
### 1. Method: configuration files
- Handled using `configuration.yaml` and `configuration*.yaml`, eventually they will be parsed again automatically.
- Allows for modular configuration using existing automation tooling

Sometimes the configuration file is too big, we could separate the configurations into dedicated files like this:

<img src="../imgs/config_files.png" width=500>

Example: in the directory `/opt/instana/agent/etc/instana` there are the configuration files. One of them `process-monitor.yaml` is printed here:

<img src="../imgs/config-1.png" width=600>


Example: other `*.cfg` files:

- `com.instana.agent.main.conf ig.UpdateManager.crg`: configuration of update frequency
- `com.instana.agent.bootstrap.AgentBootstrap.cfg`: version of the Instana Agent

<img src="../imgs/cfg.png" width=600>


### 2. Method: GitOps Configurations
Instana agents also support GitOps configuration mgmt.
<img src="../imgs/gitops.png" width=800>


# Sensors
To see which sensors are loaded, and their versions. 

<img src="../imgs/sensor_1.png" width=800>
<img src="../imgs/sensor_2.png" width=800>

`xxx-Discovery` are the Sensors that detect whether changes about `xxx` happens.
<img src="../imgs/sensor_3.png" width=800>

## Sensors Configurations
- Wherever possible, discovery and configuration is automated
- Further configuration is needed for some **sensors**
    - If locations or configuration cannot be automatically located
    - If authentication is required to access stats or metrics
    - If Instana's automated process does not work



-----------


# Demo
Spring Boot on K8S
<img src="../imgs/spring_bot.png" width=800>

Breaking the **stacks** down:

- host: `gke-k8s-demo...internal` 
- node: `gke-k8s-demo-...-3y6n`
- pod: `robot-shop...`
- container: `catalogue`
- process: `java`
- app: `Instana Demo - Catalogue app 0.0.1`

Somtimes you needs multiple **Sensors** for a particular Technology:

- The agent will reach out with its initial instrumentation via `docker exec` or `runc` commands
- **Sensors** will then be loaded in the target environment by the JVM, each with their own line of communication to the Instana agent, for example:
    - `Spring boot sensor (inc. micrometer metrics)`
    - `Java Sensor`
    - `Java Profile Sensor`
    - `Java Trace Sensor for instrumentation`


# Troubleshoting
Check the following:

- Can the **agent** talk to the **Instana backend**?
- If the **agent** is dynamic, can it talk to the Instana repo (or your mirror)?
- Check proxy set up for both the repo and the backend
- Is the `<agent key>` is correct?
- Check the `agent.log` and use `DEBUG` Mode if needed

# Instana Backend

# Infrastructure Map

## Dynamic Focus Queries

Instana uses Lucene query syntax to build complex queries. [Tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-filtering-dynamic-focus) can be found.

<img src="../imgs/query.png" width=800>

- Metadata from the monitored technology is indexed and made available for
searching via Dynamic Focus.
- Dynamic Focus is available for Infrastructure and Events.
- The Lucene query syntax is used for the query language.
- Automatic completion is available in the UI.
- Examples:
    - `entity.type:php`, `entity.type:java`
    - `entity.tag:nonprod`
    - `entity.zone:webtest`
    - `entity.kubernetes.namespace:production`
    - `entity.type:elasticsearch` OR `entity.type:cassandra` OR `entity.type:mongodb`

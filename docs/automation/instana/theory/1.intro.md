# Intro
<img src="../../imgs/apm_history.png" width=600 alt="History of APM development" />

Instana is AI powered APM(Application Performance Monitoring) solution that automatically monitors containerized, microservice applciations. It trys to automate much things as possible in the **Application Lifecycle**:

This is what Instana wants to archieve:

# Key Concepts
## 1. Auto Discovery
- One **agent**, deployed once
- Continuous real-time inventory of all components
- Automatic tracing:
    - fully automatic (zero touch) for: Java, Scala, Python, PHP, .net
    - requires Instana library inclusion: NodeJS, Golang, Ruby, Crystal
- 1 Second Granularity: big advantage in highly dynamic environment, if you have details that accurate to each seconds, you are able to see which problem comes first.

## 2. Dynamic Graph
Dynamic Graph is a **depedency tree** between all the infrastructures. It shows the connections between the services.

!!! note "Example"
    In this Dynamic Graph, there are 5 hosts: 4 for ElasticSearch, 1 for SpringBoot

## 3. Data Collection / 数据收集
数据收集是指通过各种方法、工具和技术，从软件系统中实时提取与性能、行为相关的指标、日志和追踪信息的过程。Instana收集4种信息：

1. **Metrics** - Qualitative attributes of the technology that indicate performance. E.g.:
    - Process CPU
    - Service latency
    - Web Page load time
2. **Events** - Changes: Initial discovery and state changes, Built-In Events based on failing health rules and Custom Events based on the thresholds. E.g.:
    - Host offline
    - Docker container offline
    - JVM GC Suspension High
    - Service Latency Slow
3. **Configuration** - Catalogs current settings and states in order to keep track of any configuration change
4. **Traces** - Represent transactions and are captured based upon the programming language platform. Traces are made up of one or more Calls. Java, Scala, Net, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, others via SDK.


## 4. Data Retention / 数据保留
**数据保留**是指存储已收集数据的时间长度以及如何管理这些数据以优化存储成本、性能和合规性。涉及**时间维度**，**储存策略**，**合规性要求**等等

1. **Metrics** Data Retention
    - 1 Second Granularity is stored for the last 24 hours
    - 5 Seconds for 24 hours
    - 60 seconds for 1 month
    - 5 minutes for 3 months
    - 1 hour for 13 months
2. **Events** Data Retention
    - Life of Contract
3. **Dynamic Graph/Configuration** Data Retention
    - Life of Contract
4. **Traces** Data Retention
    - 100% Full Traces for last 7 days
    - Significant Calls and KPIs for 1 year


## 5. Built-in Intelligence

- Curated Knowledge Base
    - Health Signatures & Thresholds for discovered technologies
- Pattern Detection Algorithms
    - Edge Detection/边缘检测：是图像处理和计算机视觉中的基本问题，边缘检测的目的是标识数字图像中亮度变化明显的点。图像属性中的显著变化通常反映了属性的重要事件和变化。
- Dynamic Graph
    - Entity Relationships
- Learning of Normal Patterns

## Infrastructure
In **Infrastructure Map**:

- **zone**: group of **pillars**
    - manual or automatic groupping ->  配置 agent 的时候可设置
- **pillar**: one agent
- **block** in the **pillar**: software components running on the system. 
    - The color of the **block** refects the component's health
    - a component can be: a JVM process, a TOMcat server within a JVM etc


# Tenants
Each Account can have one or more **Tenants** which can be hosted either in the Instana SaaS environment or On Prem.

- `prod-example.instana.io` -> Saas
- `pra-instana.example.com` -> On Prem (Single Docker or K8S)

!!! note "SLI & SLO"
    **Service Level Indicator (SLI)**

    An SLI is a quantitative measure of a specific aspect of service performance. It indicates how well a service is performing based on certain key metrics. SLIs are typically tied to user experience and help identify how a system is functioning in real-time. Examples of SLIs:

        - Availability: The percentage of time a service is up and accessible.
        - Latency: The time it takes for a service to respond to a request.
        - Error Rate: The percentage of failed requests out of total requests.
        - Throughput: The rate at which requests are successfully handled by the system.
    
    **Service Level Objective (SLO)**
    An SLO is a target or goal set for an SLI over a specified time period. It defines the level of performance that a service must achieve to meet the expectations of users or stakeholders. SLOs help teams set realistic and measurable objectives to maintain service quality, acting as benchmarks for reliability. Examples of SLOs:

        - Availability SLO: 99.9% uptime over a month.
        - Latency SLO: 95% of requests should respond within 200 milliseconds.
        - Error Rate SLO: Error rate should not exceed 1% of total requests.

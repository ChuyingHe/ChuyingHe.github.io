# Events

## 两种Events
### Custom Events
[Custom Event](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=alerts-defining-custom-events) enables you to create issues or incidents based on an individual metric of any given entity.



### Built-in Events

[Built-in events](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=alerts-managing-built-in-issues-incidents) are predefined health signatures based on integrated algorithms which help you to understand the health of your monitored system in real-time. You can DISABLE them under **Settings > Events** --> here you can find all the built-in Events

!!! info
    [Built-in Events Reference](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=references-built-in-events-reference)

For example, this "Erroneous Call rate too high" has a default value of `50%`. You might want to customize them by **Create A New Event**

**Changes** - A change is anything from a server start/stop, a deployment, a configuration change. E.g:
- changed configuration of components
- offline/online

**Issues** - An Issue is created if an entity gets unhealthy. They are detected by <ins>machine learning algorithms</ins> and health signatures built to detect various unhealthy situations. E.g.: 
- degradation of service
- complex infrastructure issues
- disk saturation

**Incidents** - Incidents are the highest level of events. They are created when an edge service is impacted, and they correlate all relevant events by leveraging the **Dynamic Graph** to provide context.

!!! warning "Urgency"
    Incidents > Issues > Changes


!!! note "event-specific Dynamic Focus Queries"
    - `event.state:open`
    - `event.severity:10`   (10=Severe, 5=Warning)
    - `event.text:"sudden increase in latency"`: 
    - `event.entity.label:shop`
    - `event.state:open AND event.severity:10 AND NOT event.text:"sudden increase in
    latency"`

## Event type 
将 Event 按照其严重程度分类：

- Critical incident - incident (critical).
- Warning incident - incident (warning).
- Critical issue - issue (critical).
- Warning issue - issue (warning).


### Incidents

- Multiple **Issues** correlated into one **Incident**
- **Incident** forwarded via various channels with **deep link** back to <ins>Instana Dashboard</ins>

Analyse **Incident** with UI:

<img src="../../imgs/incident_1.png" width=700>

The **Related Events** are sorted by **Dynamic Graph**:

e.g. the first 3 events are all related to the **Incident** `MySQL@3306 on demo-mysql`

<img src="../../imgs/incident_2.png" width=700>

For each **Event** we can look into its detail by clicking the "+":

!!! note "concept"
    **Triggering event**: The event that triggered this Incident
    
    **Service Impact**: Service(s) impacted by this Incident.




# Alert

Workflow of the **Alert**:

## Alert Channels
假如客户当前的生态系统中已经在使用其他工具， 比如他们习惯于用 Email或者ServiceNow 查看alert，那么 Instana 提供了可以融入进生态系统的工具 - Alert Channels。 比如，我们可以用 Alert Channels 将 Instana 中的 alerts 发送到特定的邮箱中去

## Smart Alerts
they are templates for creating new alert. Workflow of the **Smart Alert**:

**Add Smart Alert**:

<img src="../../imgs/alert_smart_2.png" width=700>


Advantages:

- easy to create
- has revisions
- possible to duplicate it
- multiple contidtions possible


# Custom Payload
**Custom Payload** is what content is sent out by the alert. The content is different depends on the **Alert Channels**. They are `key-value` pairs.

# Maintenance Windows
to create a window that mutes the alert during a certain time range. E.g. when software has a new release, we want to mute all the alert during the new deployment.
